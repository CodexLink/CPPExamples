        * Youâ€™ll notice that the file name ends with .module.css instead of the usual .css.
        * This is how you tell Gatsby that this CSS file should be processed as a CSS module
        * rather than plain CSS.

    ! TL;DR: We're declaring this stylesheet as a CSS module for Gatsby. To be used by an JSX Component.
