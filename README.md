# Code Storage

A repository that contains everything that I have done and fetched from examples to potential prototypes. They exist on this repository to test certain functionalities and discovering some new stuff that I haven't known. Feel free to use them, however, **do not hold me responsible/accountable** for anything that you may have done. See [LICENSE](https://github.com/CodexLink/CodeStorage/blob/latest/LICENSE) for more information.

> Note that, some folders do have README inside it. They may contain references from the source code that I pulled. If I do miss out, make an ISSUE or PR so that I can address it. Thank you.

## Imports

Most of the folders here do have their own repository. Though because of repository pollution, I have to merge them.

### About PY_OpenCV

It contains the repository as-is. You may find it's README and so on. Keep in mind that it's incomplete. I got strained from working on it.
