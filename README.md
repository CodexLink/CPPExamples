# CPP Examples

A repository that contains multiple C++ files that demonstrates certain functionalities under certain category.

## TLDR

Created in the means of archiving my old works / assignments for educational use. Not really designed for pulling my work as an assignment or deliverables, but can be used as a base for making such assignments for such programming courses.

### Information

The files that you see here were recently used for my deliverables (assignments) that I have received on my certain programming courses. For now, those do not contain context that may result to the code. Though, I will make my own questions in latter stages, so that it makes sense.

### Maintaining

I will be updating this repository once per week. And everytime I push new code, I will invoke automation in terms of reformatting the code. (Github Actions)

### Contributing

If you're looking to contribute, please wait while I'm going to create a formatting and syntax, which I will be using to refactor my codes later.
