# Stashed Codes

This repository contains everything that I have done from various projects. They exist to test certain functionalities and discovering some new stuff. Some of these were done because of my deliverables. Feel free to use them, however, **do not hold me responsible/accountable** for anything that you may have done.

It contains the repository as-is. You may find it's README and so on. Keep in mind that it's incomplete. I got strained from working on it.
