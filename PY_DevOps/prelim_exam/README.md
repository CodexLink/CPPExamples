# Preliminary Exam for CPE 028

Please note that the folder of target was added to simulate accessing student's files. You have to get one level directory to access all files intended for this examination.

Virtual Environment is also added here with a folder named `bin`, please instantiate the environment with `virtualenvs`. Also keep note that you may disgard the folder, it was only uploaded as a proof for virtual environment in **Instruction A**.

There are two files that I made along with a generated file:

- `parsing_data_json.py`
- `unit_testing_prelim.py`
- `COVID_19_CASES_PARSED_JSON_LICAS.csv` (***generated***)

Note that, the packages added in requirements are purely random and semi-heavy. Please attempt to install with discretion.

Time done: 10:22am
